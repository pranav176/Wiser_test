Training and Validation Accuracy/Loss:
The model shows an increasing trend in both training and validation accuracy, indicating effective learning.
Loss values for both training and validation decrease, demonstrating the model is fitting well to the data without significant overfitting.

Validation Set Evaluation:
Validation Loss: 0.6300
Validation Accuracy: 85.00%
The validation accuracy of 85% indicates that the model performs well on unseen validation data.

Test Set Evaluation:
Test Loss: 0.6500
Test Accuracy: 84.00%
The test accuracy of 84% demonstrates that the model generalizes well to completely unseen data, maintaining high performance.

The model performs well, achieving high accuracy on both validation and test sets, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.The training and validation 
curves suggest effective learning without significant overfitting. However, there is always room for improvement, particularly in addressing any misclassifications 
revealed by the confusion matrix. Future work could involve fine-tuning the model architecture, exploring different augmentation techniques, or 
incorporating additional data to further enhance performance.
